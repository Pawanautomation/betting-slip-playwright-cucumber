It looks like there is a formatting issue where the "Install Dependencies" section is being included under the "Clone the Repository" code block. To fix this, ensure each section is clearly separated. Here is the corrected version:

# Automated Betslip Testing with Playwright, TypeScript & Cucumber

This repository holds automated tests for a Gaming website's betslip functionality. It utilizes Playwright for browser automation and Cucumber for Behavior Driven Development (BDD).

## What's Included

- Test cases written in TypeScript for the betslip functionality.
- Page Object Model (POM) for efficient test organization.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js (version 14.x or higher)](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pawanautomation/betting-slip-playwright-cucumber.git
cd betting-slip-playwright-cucumber
```

### Install Dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Configure Environment:

Create a `.env` file in the project root and add:

```env
BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:5501/bet.html
```

Replace the URL with your local application's address if it differs.

### Run the Tests:

```bash
npm test
```

This command executes the tests and generates a detailed report.

### View the Report:

An HTML report (`cucumber_report.html`) will be created after running the tests. Open it in your browser to view the results.

## Project Structure

- **pages**: Contains Page Object Model classes for interacting with the webpages.
- **tests/**
  - **features**: Holds the Gherkin feature files describing test scenarios.
  - **stepDefinitions**: Contains code implementing the steps defined in features.
  - **world.js**: Custom configuration for managing the browser lifecycle.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure your local application is running at the URL specified in the `.env` file.
- If you encounter issues, verify that dependencies are installed and environment variables are set correctly.

## Contact

Feel free to reach out to the repository owner for any questions or assistance.

## For Your Reference

- **package.json**: Lists project dependencies and scripts.
- **playwright.config.ts**: Playwright configuration for browser setup and reporting.
- **generate-report.js**: Generates the HTML report from the test results.
- **cucumber.js**: Configuration for running Cucumber tests.
- **.env (Example)**: Example file demonstrating the `BASE_URL` environment variable.
```

This format should ensure that each section is properly separated and displayed correctly in your README file.
