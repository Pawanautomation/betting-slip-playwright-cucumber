Test Strategy for Betting Slip Application

1. Introduction

This document outlines the overall test strategy for the Betting Slip application. It defines the approach, types of testing to be performed (manual vs. automation), and the overall testing objectives.

2. Approach

The testing approach will be a combination of manual and automated testing techniques.

Manual Testing: This will cover core functionalities, user interface (UI) elements, user experience (UX), error handling, and various user scenarios.
Automated Testing: Unit tests will be implemented for critical calculations (odds, stake, and profit) to ensure their accuracy and consistency. Additionally, UI automation can be considered for repetitive tasks like adding/removing selections and basic validations.
3. Testing Objectives

Ensure the application functions as intended according to the requirements.
Verify all UI elements are displayed correctly and respond to user interactions.
Validate calculations for stake, odds, and potential profit are accurate.
Test error handling mechanisms for invalid user inputs and unexpected conditions.
Evaluate the overall user experience and identify any usability issues.
4. Test Levels and Coverage

Unit Testing (Automated): Focus on core functionalities like calculations and data manipulation.
Integration Testing (Manual): Verify interaction between different components like betslip and confirmation functionality.
System Testing (Manual): Test the overall application behavior, including adding selections, managing bets, and user workflows.
Usability Testing (Manual): Evaluate the user interface, user experience, and overall ease of use.
5. Automation Scope

High priority: Automate unit tests for critical calculations (stake, odds, profit) to ensure their accuracy and reliability.
Optional: Implement UI automation tests for repetitive tasks like adding/removing selections from the betslip and basic validations on user input.
6. Manual Testing Scope

All UI elements and functionalities (adding selections, stake adjustment, bet confirmation, etc.)
User experience and workflow testing for various scenarios (adding/removing bets, using bonus options, etc.)
Error handling and edge case testing (invalid inputs, unexpected conditions)
Accessibility testing to ensure the application is usable by users with disabilities
7. Tools and Techniques

Manual Testing: Utilize exploratory testing, test case design techniques, and user experience evaluation methods.
Automation Testing: A testing framework like JEST or Mocha can be used for unit test automation. Consider UI automation tools like Playwright if needed for broader automation.
8. Reporting and Defect Management

All test results will be documented and logged in a test management tool.
Identified defects will be reported with detailed descriptions, steps to reproduce, and expected behavior.
9. Test Schedule and Resources

The test schedule will be integrated with the overall development timeline.
Manual testing will be primarily conducted by a dedicated QA tester.
Automation efforts will depend on available resources and the complexity of automation chosen.
10. Conclusion

This test strategy provides a framework for comprehensive testing of the Betting Slip application. By combining manual and automated testing techniques, we aim to ensure the application delivers a high-quality and user-friendly experience
